   Let's consider this case:
   You have a lint task that runs on pre-commit hook.
   You're modifying the file x.js and you git add it.
   Now you left to do something else and didn't commit yet.
   You then return to this file and perform more changes that should not be part of the commit on x.js.
   You're trying to commit the stagged changes you git add and your lint task fails the commit.
   If you haven't restored the tree what will happen is the stash pop command will try to auto merge x.js and then
   it will have the unstagged changes now be in the stagged changes - which is something you did not want.

   So running git reset --hard command is to take care of situations where you have the same files in the stagged and unstagged changes.
